## ⚡ Downed Power Line Safety

### CRITICAL: Treat ALL Downed Power Lines as LIVE and DEADLY

**A downed power line can kill you instantly. You CANNOT tell if a line is energized just by looking at it.**

### If You See a Downed Power Line

#### DO:
✅ **Stay at least 35 feet (10 meters) away** from the line and anything touching it
✅ **Call 911 immediately**
✅ **Call GPL emergency hotline** for your region
✅ **Keep others away** - warn anyone approaching
✅ **Stay on scene** safely to warn others until help arrives
✅ **Assume the line is LIVE** - even if it's not sparking or moving

#### DO NOT:
❌ **DO NOT touch** the power line or anything touching it
❌ **DO NOT attempt to move** the line with any object (stick, broom, etc.)
❌ **DO NOT touch anyone** who is in contact with the line
❌ **DO NOT drive over** downed power lines
❌ **DO NOT touch or step in water** near downed lines
❌ **DO NOT assume** the line is dead because it's not sparking

### Ground Current Danger Zone
The ground around a downed power line can be energized up to **35 feet (10 meters) away**. Electricity travels through the ground in invisible pathways.

**If you're too close:**
- Keep feet together
- Shuffle away (don't walk normally)
- Do NOT run or take large steps

## 🚗 Vehicle Safety Near Power Lines

### If Your Vehicle Contacts a Power Line

#### Stay Inside If Safe:
1. **DO NOT exit** the vehicle
2. **Call 911** and GPL emergency hotline
3. **Honk your horn** continuously to alert others
4. **Warn others** to stay away from your vehicle
5. **Wait for utility crews** to de-energize the line

#### Exit Only If There's Fire:
1. **Open door** without touching metal parts
2. **Jump clear** of vehicle with both feet together
3. **Do NOT touch** vehicle and ground at same time
4. **Land with feet together**
5. **Shuffle away** - keep feet together, small steps
6. **Get at least 35 feet away**

### Why Shuffle?
Walking normally creates a "step potential" - different voltage points that electricity can travel through your body. Shuffling keeps your feet at the same voltage level.
